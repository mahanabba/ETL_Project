  For our analysis we decided to gather information in regard to football player statistics. With the football draft just recently ending, some questions arose that initiated our choice of subject. Some of the questions that arose were, “Which collegiate football team has the highest amount of penalties and fines”?, “What factors play a key component in these penalties, is it age, position etc? To gather the data, we used two different sites, kaggle.com and data.world. From the sites were able to use two datasets, (https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/nfl-football-player-stats) and (https://data.world/alice-c/nfl-fines-and-suspensions ). Once our datasets were chosen, we created data frames within Jupyter Notebook using Pandas. With the data frames we created, we were able to merge and combine the data into one table. Once merged, we extracted the columns that we felt were unnecessary to include in the data we were trying to gather.
